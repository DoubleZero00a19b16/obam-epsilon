## 🚀 The Problem: "Data Blindness"
OBA Markets is a retail giant, but it faces a silent problem common in the "Hard Discount" sector:
1.  **Private Label Risk:** When an OBA-brand product fails, the company doesn't know *why* (Taste? Packaging? Price?). This leads to millions in wasted inventory.
2.  **The "Silent Majority" Gap:** Retailers only hear from customers when they are angry. There is zero data on what customers love, making it hard to identify "Winning Products."
3.  **Export Uncertainty:** Without concrete data on local popularity, it is difficult to convince foreign distributors (in Georgia, Russia, etc.) to import OBA products.

## 💡 The Solution: Incentivized Product Intelligence
**OBA Rate & Earn** is a mobile integration that transforms the loyalty app into a **Crowdsourced R&D Department**.

We incentivize customers to rate products after purchase. By gamifying the feedback loop, we gather "Healthy Data" that allows OBA to:
*   **Optimize Manufacturing:** Know exactly why a product is rated 2 stars (e.g., "Too salty") and fix the recipe immediately.
*   **Power Export Strategy:** Use 5-star rating data as proof of quality to enter international markets.
*   **Predict Demand:** Identify viral products before they sell out.

## 📱 Key Features

### 1. 🛍️ Smart Receipt Integration
*   Users see their past receipts automatically synced to the app.
*   No need to scan QR codes manually; it's linked to the OBA Bonus Card.

### 2. ⭐ The "Reason-Based" Rating Engine
*   **5 Stars:** Immediate success animation (+1 Point).
*   **1-2 Stars:** Triggers a **Feedback Modal**. The user *must* select a reason (Quality, Price, Packaging) to earn points. This provides actionable data for the factory.
*   **Anti-Spam Logic:** Users are limited to **3 ratings per receipt** to prevent data pollution.

### 3. 🎮 Gamification & Ranks (The Hook)
We keep users addicted to giving data through a tiered loyalty system:
*   **🥉 Bronze Neighbor:** Standard Cashback.
*   **🥈 Silver Friend:** +2% Cashback on Private Label (PL) products.
*   **🥇 Golden Partner:** +5% Cashback + Exclusive Gifts.
*   **🎁 Milestones:** Unlocking free items (Coffee, Discounts) at 30, 50, and 80 points.
